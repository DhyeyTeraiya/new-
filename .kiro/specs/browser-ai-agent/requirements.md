2. WHEN jobs are found THEN the system SHALL extract title, company, location, salary, and requirements
3. WHEN applying to jobs THEN the system SHALL use stored resume and cover letter templates
4. WHEN application forms appear THEN the system SHALL answer standard questions intelligently
5. WHEN applications are submitted THEN the system SHALL track success/failure rates and provide detailed reports

### Requirement 5: Company Research & Contact Scraping

**User Story:** As a business professional, I want comprehensive company research and contact information extraction, so that I can build targeted outreach campaigns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN company research is requested THEN the system SHALL gather company info from multiple sources
2. WHEN extracting contacts THEN the system SHALL find emails, phone numbers, and social media profiles
3. WHEN processing company data THEN the system SHALL structure information including industry, size, and key personnel
4. WHEN research is complete THEN the system SHALL verify data accuracy using multiple validation methods
5. WHEN sensitive data is found THEN the system SHALL handle it according to privacy regulations

### Requirement 6: Cloud Execution & Persistence

**User Story:** As a user, I want tasks to continue running even when I close my browser, so that long-running automations complete without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is started THEN the system SHALL execute it on cloud infrastructure independent of user browser
2. WHEN users disconnect THEN the system SHALL continue task execution and store progress
3. WHEN users reconnect THEN the system SHALL restore session state and show current progress
4. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL notify users via email or push notifications
5. WHEN system restarts THEN the system SHALL resume interrupted tasks from last checkpoint

### Requirement 7: Real-time Progress Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see live updates of task progress with detailed step-by-step information, so that I can monitor automation status and intervene if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks execute THEN the system SHALL provide real-time updates via WebSocket connections
2. WHEN progress updates occur THEN the system SHALL show current step, completion percentage, and estimated time remaining
3. WHEN errors happen THEN the system SHALL immediately notify users with actionable error messages
4. WHEN tasks pause THEN the system SHALL allow users to resume, modify, or cancel operations
5. WHEN multiple tasks run THEN the system SHALL display progress for all concurrent operations

### Requirement 8: Data Export & Reporting

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export task results in professional formats (PDF, Word, Excel), so that I can share findings with colleagues or use data in other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports with all extracted data
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support PDF, Word, Excel, and JSON formats
